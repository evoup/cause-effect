Welcome!

This Git repository is for members of the meetup group Data Insights Cambridge, 
who are participating in the Data Insights team in the Kaggle competition 
'Cause-effect pairs’ (http://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

Plan:
A‘Data Insights Cambridge’ team has been created on Kaggle. Please join this. 
James Lloyd has downloaded into this Git repository the competition data and any other relevant docs. 

Please work on your own separate predictions, and submit your solutions to the Git repository when ready. 
James will then lead the aggregation of the predictions (we might get-together for a ‘hack day’ to do this) 
James will submit final solutions to Kaggle by the deadline (in about 3 months). 
There will be a get-together scheduled for about 4-6 weeks time for all participants to touch-base 
(details will be posted on meetup.com).
